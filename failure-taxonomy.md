# Failure Taxonomy

This is a pragmatic classification used for indexing.

## F0: Constraint Drift
Output gradually stops respecting allowed outputs, but does not directly violate.

## F1: Soft Violation
Output includes minor forbidden elements (tone, flourish, speculation indicators).

## F2: Hard Violation
Output contains explicitly forbidden content classes.

## F3: Collapse
Output becomes non-coherent, circular, or meta-only.
Often observed after repeated enforcement events.

## F4: Mirror Failure
Room begins reflecting operator instructions rather than executing within ontology.

## F5: Sink Saturation
Hallucination sink room becomes a generator rather than an absorber.
